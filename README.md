# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Daniel.

I'm a [product engineer][1], writing software for the web.

My tools of choice for many years now have been [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org) and
[Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org).

I've worked at startups, agencies, incubators, and large organisations, both locally and remotely.

If you'd like to reach out you can email me at [dnlgrv@hey.com](mailto:dnlgrv@hey.com).
